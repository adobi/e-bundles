ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template 2.9

HTML::Template - a Perl module to use HTML Templates

CHANGES

   - New Feature: the new default_escape option allows you to apply
     escaping to all variables in a template. [Alex Kapranoff]

   - Bug Fix: ESCAPE wasn't working on variables containing code-refs.

   - Bug Fix: Changed HTML::Template to help sub-classes by called
     _new_from_loop() via ref($self) rather than hard-coding the package
     name. [Mark Stosberg]

   - Bug Fix: Including more than one <tmpl_else> tag in <tmpl_unless> or
     <tmpl_unless> now dies with an error message, instead of silently ignoring
     one of the clauses. [Mitar and Mark Stosberg]

   - Bug Fix: Fixed HTML::Template to re-evaluate conditions to handle
     <tmpl_else>.  This bug could cause HTML::Template to take both
     branches of a conditional if a code-ref parameter returned a
     different value when called a second time. [Emanuele Zeppieri]

DESCRIPTION

    This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural. It
    extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
    <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF>, <TMPL_ELSE> and <TMPL_UNLESS>.
    The file written with HTML and these new tags is called a template. It
    is usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
    someone else! Using this module you fill in the values for the
    variables, loops and branches declared in the template. This allows you
    to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate in the
    Perl script.

    This module is licensed under the GPL. See the LICENSE section below for
    more details.
