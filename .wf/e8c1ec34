Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played.

Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage.

                    <p>Invictus Games Ltd. does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of Invictus Games Ltd. customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age.</p>
                    <p>From time to time, Invictus Games Ltd. employs third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal information you provide to us.</p>
                    <p>When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, Invictus Games Ltd. requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of personal information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by Invictus Games Ltd.. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.</p>
                    <p>You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>
                    <p>We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Invictus Games Ltd.. Note that certain publically available information you post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI for more details.</p>
                    
                    <h5>VII.    Where Is The Information Held?</h5>
                    <p>Invictus Games Ltd. is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on which Invictus Games Ltd. collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives are based in Hungary. Under limited circumstances, we may utilize data storage facilities located in the United States of America, Asia and/or the European Union. Your personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by Invictus Games Ltd. in Hungary and in other countries, including countries both in and outside North America, the European Union and Asia, and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    
                    <h5>VIII.    How Does Invictus Games Ltd. Protect Your Personal Information?</h5>
                    <p>The security of you and your child’s personal information is important to us. We use generally accepted methods to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact the Privacy Policy Administrator via support@invictus.hu.</p>
                    
                    <h5>IX.    Review, Correction Of Your Information, Requesting Removal From Mailing Lists And Deactivating Your Account</h5>
                    <p>You can correct or update your account information at any time by logging on our site and navigating to “My Account,” “View My Profile” or other account settings. Should you be unable to log in or wish to have your account(s) deactivated, contact the Privacy Policy Administrator via support@invictus.hu, or if your country is not listed. We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. We may still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our websites.</p>
                    <p>Some Invictus Games Ltd. sites or services may collect personal information that is not accessible via our site. However, in such cases, you may be able to access that information through alternative means of access described by the service or by writing the privacy policy administrator via support@invictus.hu and you will be contacted within 30 days regarding your request.</p>
                    
                    <h5>X.    A Special Note About Children</h5>
                    <p>Invictus Games Ltd. encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Invictus Games Ltd. online sites by children 12 years of age or under.</p>
                    <p>If children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions wish to participate in online activities that require or permit the disclosure of personal information, we will request that they provide their parent or guardian's email address to notify the parent, obtain prior permission or other verifiable consent from the parent or guardian as may be necessary to participate in the activities of the site. In some other jurisdictions, notification, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required of a parent or guardian for children from 13 to 17 years of age.</p>
                    <p>Some Invictus Games Ltd. websites are especially targeted to children and may permit children to create a free account for which we collect username, password, date of birth and the parent’s email address. Because an email address is necessary to respond to lost password requests and account administration, in some circumstances we may also collect the child’s email address. In these instances we will send notice to the parent email address to provide an opportunity to opt-out and have the child’s email address and any other details removed. Newsletter subscriptions are handled similarly.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>These websites may also offer parents the opportunity to upgrade their child’s account to a paid subscription that permits the child to participate in more activities on the site. These subscription services may also enable parents to manage their child’s account and create new player accounts.</p>
                    <p>Most of these websites permit children to create custom avatars, or virtual cartoon-like characters, for use in various activities on the website including mini-games and virtual worlds. The child may also use other features to “Tell a Friend” about the website, send eCards or give us feedback. “Tell a Friend” and eCard features allow children to send their friends a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We will collect your child’s first name and/or email address and the friend’s email address for the sole purpose of sending them this one-time email. This information is not retained or used for any other purpose and we do not share your child’s email address with the recipient.</p>
                    <p>Feedback may also be provided to Invictus Games Ltd. through “Tell us what you think” features or surveys. “Tell us what you think” collects the sender’s email address and a brief description of their concern. Email addresses obtained through “Tell us what you think” are not used for any purpose other than to respond to the sender. If we determine that the child is under 12, we will delete their email address once we have responded to their inquiry. Survey information is anonymous.</p>
                    <p>Where chat is allowed for children, users type messages to other users in an open forum setting. In these circumstances, Invictus Games Ltd. uses Safe Chat which restricts children from entering any personally identifiable information by applying a filter to allow only acceptable words and phrases in an attempt to block offensive content as well as attempts to communicate personally identifiable information to other users. Safe Chat also provides users the option of selecting pre-approved common phrases. Where chat is provided, Report Abuse links are also maintained to further enhance the safety of the site.</p>
                    <p>Parents may delete previously registered players at any time by emailing through <a href="mailto:support@invictus.hu">support@invictus.hu</a>.</p>
                    <p>Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child’s information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.</p>
                    <p>Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent. Where consent is granted, consent is applicable only to that site. Regardless of jurisdiction, Invictus Games Ltd. does not disclose any personal information about children less than 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy.</p>
                    <p>If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by Invictus Games Ltd. is not correct or complete, should you wish to have your child's personal information deleted from our records, or if you want Invictus Games Ltd. to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact the Privacy Policy Administrator via support@invictus.hu. The Privacy Policy Administrator will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.</p>
                    
                    <h5>XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles</h5>
                    <p>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to Invictus Games Ltd. sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.  </p>

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums.</p>
                    <p>Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies.  Invictus Games Ltd. has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.</p>
                    <p>If you post a video, image or photo on one of our sites for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to submit to Invictus Games Ltd.’s site. </p>

                    <p>Our website may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Invictus Games Ltd. site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Invictus Games Ltd.. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Invictus Games Ltd. site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>

Certain products and/or services available on our site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose personally identifiable information in order to register for and access such products and/or services.
